            <remarks>
            If <c>IsVisible</c> is set to <c>false</c>, the WebView is transparent and is not rendered. However, this does not affect the window containing the WebView (the <c>ParentWindow</c> parameter that was passed to <see cref="M:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Environment.CreateCoreWebView2ControllerAsync(System.IntPtr)"/>). If you want that window to disappear too, run <see cref="M:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Hide"/> or <see cref="!:System.Windows.Window.Hide"/> on it directly in addition to modifying this.
            WebView as a child window does not get window messages when the top window is minimized or restored. For performance reason, developer should set <c>IsVisible</c> property of the WebView to <c>false</c> when the app window is minimized and back to <c>true</c> when app window is restored. App window can do this by handling SC_MINIMIZE and SC_RESTORE command upon receiving <c>WM_SYSCOMMAND</c> message.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Bounds are relative to the <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.ParentWindow"/>. The app has two ways to position a WebView:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item><description>
            Create a child HWND that is the WebView parent HWND. Position the window where the WebView should be. Use (0, 0) for the top-left corner (the offset) of the Bounds of the WebView.
            </description></item>
            <item><description>
            Use the top-most window of the app as the WebView parent HWND. For example, to position ebView correctly in the app, set the top-left corner of the Bounds of the WebView.
            </description></item>
            </list>
            
            The values of Bounds are limited by the coordinate space of the host.

        <member name="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.ZoomFactor">
            <summary>
            Gets or sets the zoom factor for the WebView.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Note that changing zoom factor may cause <c>window.innerWidth</c> or <c>window.innerHeight</c> and page layout to change. A zoom factor that is applied by the host by setting this ZoomFactor property becomes the new default zoom for the WebView. This zoom factor applies across navigations and is the zoom factor WebView is returned to when the user presses Ctrl+0. When the zoom factor is changed by the user (resulting in the app receiving <see cref="E:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.ZoomFactorChanged"/>), that zoom applies only for the current page. Any user applied zoom is only for the current page and is reset on a navigation. Specifying a ZoomFactor less than or equal to 0 is not allowed. WebView also has an internal supported zoom factor range. When a specified zoom factor is out of that range, it is normalized to be within the range, and a <see cref="E:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.ZoomFactorChanged"/> event is raised for the real applied zoom factor. When this range normalization happens, this reports the zoom factor specified during the previous modification of the ZoomFactor property until the <see cref="E:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.ZoomFactorChanged"/> event is received after WebView applies the normalized zoom factor.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            It initially returns the <c>ParentWindow</c> passed into <see cref="M:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Environment.CreateCoreWebView2ControllerAsync(System.IntPtr)"/>. Setting the property causes the WebView to re-parent the main WebView window to the newly provided window.

        <member name="E:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.ZoomFactorChanged">
            <summary>
            ZoomFactorChanged is raised when the <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.ZoomFactor"/> property changes.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The event may be raised because the <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.ZoomFactor"/> property was modified, or due to the user manually modifying the zoom. When it is modified using the <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.ZoomFactor"/> property, the internal zoom factor is updated immediately and no ZoomFactorChanged event is raised. WebView associates the last used zoom factor for each site. It is possible for the zoom factor to change when navigating to a different page. When the zoom factor changes due to a navigation change, the ZoomFactorChanged event is raised right after the <see cref ="E:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2.ContentLoading"/> event.

            <remarks>
            In the case where <see cref="E:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.MoveFocusRequested"/> event is raised, the focus is still on WebView when <see cref="E:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.MoveFocusRequested"/> event is raised. LostFocus is only raised afterwards when code of the app or default action of <see cref="E:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.MoveFocusRequested"/> event sets focus away from WebView.

        <member name="E:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.AcceleratorKeyPressed">
            <summary>
            AcceleratorKeyPressed is raised when an accelerator key or key combo is pressed or released while the WebView is focused.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            A key is considered an accelerator if either of the following conditions are true:
            
            <list type="bullet">
            <item><description>
            Ctrl or Alt is currently being held.
            </description></item>
            <item><description>
            The pressed key does not map to a character.
            </description></item>
            </list>
            
            A few specific keys are never considered accelerators, such as Shift. The Escape key is always considered an accelerator.
            
            Autorepeated key events caused by holding the key down will also raise this event. Filter out the auto-repeated key events by verifying <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2AcceleratorKeyPressedEventArgs.KeyEventLParam"/> or <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2AcceleratorKeyPressedEventArgs.PhysicalKeyStatus"/>.
            
            In windowed mode, this event is synchronous. Until you set <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2AcceleratorKeyPressedEventArgs.Handled"/> to <c>true</c> or the event handler returns, the browser process is blocked and outgoing cross-process COM calls will fail with RPC_E_CANTCALLOUT_ININPUTSYNCCALL. All <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.CoreWebView2"/> methods work, however.
            
            In windowless mode, the event is asynchronous. Further input do not reach the browser until the event handler returns or <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2AcceleratorKeyPressedEventArgs.Handled"/> is set to <c>true</c>, but the browser process is not blocked, and outgoing COM calls work normally.
            
            It is recommended to set <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2AcceleratorKeyPressedEventArgs.Handled"/> to <c>true</c> as early as you are able to know that you want to handle the accelerator key.

            This operation is atomic from the perspective of the host. After returning from this function, the <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.Bounds"/> and <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.ZoomFactor"/> properties are both updated if the function is successful, or neither is updated if the function fails. If <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.Bounds"/> and <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.ZoomFactor"/> are both updated by the same scale (for example, <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.Bounds"/> and <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.ZoomFactor"/> are both doubled), then the page does not display a change in <c>window.innerWidth</c> or <c>window.innerHeight</c> and the WebView renders the content at the new size and zoom without intermediate renderings. This function also updates just one of <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.ZoomFactor"/> or <see cref="P:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller.Bounds"/> by passing in the new value for one and the current value for the other.

            <param name="reason">The reason for moving focus.</param>
            <remarks>
            WebView will get focus and focus will be set to correspondent element in the page hosted in the WebView. For <see cref="F:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2MoveFocusReason.Programmatic"/> reason, focus is set to previously focused element or the default element if no previously focused element exists. For <see cref="F:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2MoveFocusReason.Next"/> reason, focus is set to the first element. For <see cref="F:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2MoveFocusReason.Previous"/> reason, focus is set to the last element. WebView changes focus through user interaction including selecting into a WebView or Tab into it. For tabbing, the app runs MoveFocus with <see cref="F:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2MoveFocusReason.Next"/> or <see cref="F:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2MoveFocusReason.Previous"/> to align with Tab and Shift+Tab respectively when it decides the WebView is the next tabbable element.

            Closes the WebView and cleans up the underlying browser instance.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Cleaning up the browser instance releases the resources powering the WebView. The browser instance is shut down if no other WebViews are using it.
            
            After running Close, all methods fail and event handlers stop running. Specifically, the WebView releases the associated references to any associated event handlers when Close is run.
            
            Close is implicitly run when the <see cref="T:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2Controller"/> loses the final reference and is destructed. But it is best practice to explicitly run Close to avoid any accidental cycle of references between the WebView and the app code. Specifically, if you capture a reference to the WebView in an event handler you create a reference cycle between the WebView and the event handler. Run Close to break the cycle by releasing all event handlers. But to avoid the situation, it is best to both explicitly run Close on the WebView and to not capture a reference to the WebView to ensure the WebView is cleaned up correctly.

            To use the newer version of the browser you must create a new environment and WebView. The event is only raised for new version from the same WebView2 Runtime from which the code is running. When not running with installed WebView2 Runtime, no event is raised.
            
            Because a user data folder is only able to be used by one browser process at a time, if you want to use the same user data folder in the WebViews using the new version of the browser, you must close the environment and instance of WebView that are using the older version of the browser first. Or simply prompt the user to restart the app.

There is no requirement for you to respect the values. If your app does not have corresponding UI features (for example, no toolbar) or if all instance of WebView are opened in tabs and do not have distinct size or positions, then your app does not respect the values. You may want to respect values, but perhaps only some apply to the UI of you app. Accordingly, you may respect all, some, or none of the properties as appropriate for your app. For all numeric properties, if the value that is passed to <c>window.open()</c> is outside the range of an <see cref="T:System.UInt32"/>, the resulting value is <see cref="F:System.UInt32.MaxValue"/>. If you are not able to parse the value an integer, it is considered 0. If the value is a floating point value, it is rounded down to an integer.

            <summary>
            Adds the provided host object to script running in the WebView with the specified name.
            </summary>

            <remarks>
            Host objects are exposed as host object proxies via <c>window.chrome.webview.hostObjects.{name}</c>. Host object proxies are promises and will resolve to an object representing the host object. Only the COM visible objects/properties/methods can be accessed from script. The app can control which part of .NET objects are exposed using <see cref="T:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisibleAttribute"/>.
            
            JavaScript code in the WebView will be able to access appObject as following and then access attributes and methods of appObject.
            
            To create a [IDispatch](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch) implementing class in C# use the following attributes on each class you intend to expose.
            <code>
            // Bridge and BridgeAnotherClass are C# classes that implement IDispatch and works with AddHostObjectToScript.
            [ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.AutoDual)]
            [ComVisible(true)]
            public class BridgeAnotherClass
            {
                // Sample property.
                public string Prop { get; set; } = "Example";
            }
            
            [ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.AutoDual)]
            [ComVisible(true)]
            public class Bridge
            {
                public string Func(string param)
                {
                    return "Example: " + param;
                }
            
                public BridgeAnotherClass AnotherObject { get; set; } = new BridgeAnotherClass();
            
                // Sample indexed property.
                [System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IndexerName("Items")]
                public string this[int index]
                {
                    get { return m_dictionary[index]; }
                    set { m_dictionary[index] = value; }
                }
                private Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; m_dictionary = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;();
            }
            </code>
            Then add instances of those classes via <see cref="M:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2.AddHostObjectToScript(System.String,System.Object)"/>:
            <code>
            webView.CoreWebView2.AddHostObjectToScript("bridge", new Bridge());
            </code>
            And then in script you can call the methods, and access those properties of the objects added via <see cref="M:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.CoreWebView2.AddHostObjectToScript(System.String,System.Object)"/>:
            <code>
            // Find added objects on the hostObjects property
            const bridge = chrome.webview.hostObjects.bridge;
            
            // Call a method and pass in a parameter.
            // The result is another proxy promise so you must await to get the result.
            console.log(await bridge.Func("testing..."));
            
            // A property may be another object as long as its class also implements
            // IDispatch.
            // Getting a property also gets a proxy promise you must await.
            const propValue = await bridge.AnotherObject.Prop;
            console.log(propValue);
            
            // Indexed properties
            let index = 123;
            bridge[index] = "test";
            let result = await bridge[index];
            console.log(result);
            </code>
            
            Note that while simple types, <c>IDispatch</c> and array are supported, generic <c>IUnknown</c>, <c>VT_DECIMAL</c>, or <c>VT_RECORD</c> variant is not supported. Remote JavaScript objects like callback functions are represented as an <c>VT_DISPATCH</c> VARIANT with the object implementing <c>IDispatch</c>. The JavaScript callback method may be invoked using DISPID_VALUE for the DISPID. Nested arrays are supported up to a depth of 3. Arrays of by reference types are not supported. <c>VT_EMPTY</c> and <c>VT_NULL</c> are mapped into JavaScript as <c>null</c>. In JavaScript <c>null</c> and <c>undefined</c> are mapped to <c>VT_EMPTY</c>.
            
            Additionally, all host objects are exposed as <c>window.chrome.webview.hostObjects.sync.{name}</c>. Here the host objects are exposed as synchronous host object proxies. These are not promises and calls to functions or property access synchronously block running script waiting to communicate cross process for the host code to run. Accordingly this can result in reliability issues and it is recommended that you use the promise based asynchronous <c>window.chrome.webview.hostObjects.{name}</c> API described above.
            
            Synchronous host object proxies and asynchronous host object proxies can both proxy the same host object. Remote changes made by one proxy will be reflected in any other proxy of that same host object whether the other proxies and synchronous or asynchronous.
            
            While JavaScript is blocked on a synchronous call to native code, that native code is unable to call back to JavaScript. Attempts to do so will fail with <c>HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_POSSIBLE_DEADLOCK)</c>.
            
            Host object proxies are JavaScript Proxy objects that intercept all property get, property set, and method invocations. Properties or methods that are a part of the Function or Object prototype are run locally. Additionally any property or method in the array <c>chrome.webview.hostObjects.options.forceLocalProperties</c> will also be run locally. This defaults to including optional methods that have meaning in JavaScript like <c>toJSON</c> and <c>Symbol.toPrimitive</c>. You can add more to this array as required.
            
            There's a method <c>chrome.webview.hostObjects.cleanupSome</c> that will best effort garbage collect host object proxies.
            
            Host object proxies additionally have the following methods which run locally:
            
            <list type="bullet">
            <item>
            <description>

            <item>
            <term><c>applyHostFunction</c>, <c>getHostProperty</c>, <c>setHostProperty</c></term>
            <description>
            Perform a method invocation, property get, or property set on the host object. You can use these to explicitly force a method or property to run remotely if there is a conflicting local method or property. For instance, <c>proxy.toString()</c> will run the local <c>toString</c> method on the proxy object. But <c>proxy.applyHostFunction('toString')</c> runs <c>toString</c> on the host proxied object instead.

            <item>
            <term><c>getLocalProperty</c>, <c>setLocalProperty</c></term>
            <description>
            Perform property get, or property set locally. You can use these methods to force getting or setting a property on the host object proxy itself rather than on the host object it represents. For instance, <c>proxy.unknownProperty</c> will get the property named <c>unknownProperty</c> from the host proxied object. But <c>proxy.getLocalProperty('unknownProperty')</c> will get the value of the property <c>unknownProperty</c> on the proxy object itself.

            <description>
            Asynchronous host object proxies expose a sync method which returns a promise for a synchronous host object proxy for the same host object. For example, <c>chrome.webview.hostObjects.sample.methodCall()</c> returns an asynchronous host object proxy. You can use the <c>sync</c> method to obtain a synchronous host object proxy instead: 
            <code>const syncProxy = await chrome.webview.hostObjects.sample.methodCall().sync()</code>
            </description>
            </item>

            <term><c>async</c></term>
            <description>
            Synchronous host object proxies expose an async method which blocks and returns an asynchronous host object proxy for the same host object. For example, <c>chrome.webview.hostObjects.sync.sample.methodCall()</c> returns a synchronous host object proxy. Calling the <c>async</c> method on this blocks and then returns an asynchronous host object proxy for the same host object: <code>const asyncProxy = chrome.webview.hostObjects.sync.sample.methodCall().async()</code>
            </description>
            </item>
            <item>
            <term><c>then</c></term>
            <description>
            Asynchronous host object proxies have a then method. This allows them to be awaitable. <c>then</c> will return a promise that resolves with a representation of the host object. If the proxy represents a JavaScript literal then a copy of that is returned locally. If the proxy represents a function then a non-awaitable proxy is returned. If the proxy represents a JavaScript object with a mix of literal properties and function properties, then the a copy of the object is returned with some properties as host object proxies.
            </description>
            </item>
            </list>
            
            All other property and method invocations (other than the above Remote object proxy methods, <c>forceLocalProperties</c> list, and properties on Function and Object prototypes) are run remotely. Asynchronous host object proxies return a promise representing asynchronous completion of remotely invoking the method, or getting the property. The promise resolves after the remote operations complete and the promises resolve to the resulting value of the operation. Synchronous host object proxies work similarly but block JavaScript execution and wait for the remote operation to complete.
            
            Setting a property on an asynchronous host object proxy works slightly differently. The set returns immediately and the return value is the value that will be set. This is a requirement of the JavaScript Proxy object. If you need to asynchronously wait for the property set to complete, use the <c>setHostProperty</c> method which returns a promise as described above. Synchronous object property set property synchronously blocks until the property is set.
            
            Exposing host objects to script has security risk. Please follow [best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/concepts/security).
