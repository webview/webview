/**
 * @brief Error codes returned to callers of the API.
 *
 * The following codes are commonly used in the library:
 * - @c WEBVIEW_ERROR_OK
 * - @c WEBVIEW_ERROR_UNSPECIFIED
 * - @c WEBVIEW_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
 * - @c WEBVIEW_ERROR_INVALID_STATE
 *
 * With the exception of @c WEBVIEW_ERROR_OK which is normally expected,
 * the other common codes do not normally need to be handled specifically.
 * Refer to specific functions regarding handling of other codes.
